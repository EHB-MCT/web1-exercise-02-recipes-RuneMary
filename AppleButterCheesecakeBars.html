		<h3>Cheesecake Filling</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>3 (8-ounce) packages cream cheese, at room temperature</li>

			<li>3/4 cup sour cream, at room temperature</li>

			<li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>

			<li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>

			<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

			<li>3/4 cup apple butter</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Directions</h2>

		<ol>
			<li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
			<li>
				Prepare the Graham Cracker Crust: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175
				degrees C) with rack in lower third position. Line a 9- x 13-inch baking
				pan with aluminum foil, leaving a 2-inch overhang on the long sides.
				Lightly coat pan and foil with cooking spray.
			</li>
			<li>
				Stir together graham cracker crumbs, butter, sugar, cinnamon, and salt
				in a large bowl until combined and evenly moistened. Press mixture
				evenly into the bottom of the prepared pan.
			</li>
			<li>
				Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden and fragrant, 7 to 10
				minutes. Let cool slightly, about 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to
				300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
			</li>
			<li>
				Prepare the Cheesecake Filling: Beat cream cheese and sour cream in a
				stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium speed until
				fluffy and fully combined, 3 to 4 minutes. Beat in sugar and salt on
				medium speed until combined, about 1 minute.
			</li>
			<li>
				Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating on low speed just until combined after
				each addition and stopping to scrape down sides of bowl with a rubber
				spatula as needed, 1 to 2 minutes total. Add heavy cream and vanilla
				extract; beat on low speed just until combined.
			</li>
			<li>
				Pour Cheesecake Filling into cooled Graham Cracker Crust. Evenly dollop
				apple butter over Cheesecake Filling; using a butter knife or small
				spatula inserted about halfway into filling, decoratively swirl apple
				butter using zig-zag motions until desired distribution.
			</li>
			<li>
				Place baking pan inside a large roasting pan and place in preheated
				oven. Pour boiling water into roasting pan so it reaches halfway up the
				sides of the baking pan. Bake at 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) until
				cheesecake slightly jiggles when shaken but is set around the edges, 35
				to 40 minutes.
			</li>
			<li>
				Turn off oven and leave oven door cracked open 7 to 8 inches; let
				cheesecake cool in oven for 30 minutes. Remove roasting pan from oven
				and carefully remove cheesecake from water bath. Let cool in pan at room
				temperature 30 minutes, then cover and refrigerate until completely
				chilled, at least 4 hours or up to overnight.
			</li>
			<li>
				Using foil overhang as handles, lift the cheesecake out of the pan and
				place it onto a cutting board. Cut it into 12 (3 x 2 1/2-inch)
				rectangles. Serve chilled.
			</li>
